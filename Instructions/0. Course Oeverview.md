The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.

The choice between Linux and Windows as an operating system (OS) depends on the user’s needs and preferences. Linux is a popular choice for developers and those who prefer open-source software, as the source code is freely available for modification and distribution.

Nowadays, consoles and terminals, in Linux, are usually things that exist in software, rather than hardware. For example:

•  When you see Linux boot and a bunch of text appears on screen, telling you what happens as the operating system is loading – that’s the **console**.

•  After a Linux machine has booted, if you press **CTRL+ALT+F2** on the keyboard, you’ll see a **virtual terminal (vt2)**.

•  If you have Linux installed on your desktop, with a graphical user interface, when you want to type commands you open up a **terminal emulator**

Let’s move back to logins. In practice, most often you’ll log in to remote Linux systems. But let’s start with the less common scenarios.

### Logging into Local Linux Systems
“Local” is just a tech word for “something that is in front of you” or “something you can physically access”. A computer on your desk is local. A server running on Google Cloud is **remote**.
#### Local GUI
<p align="justify">
Usually, when Linux is installed on servers, it is installed without GUI (Graphical User Interface) components. There’s no mouse pointer, no buttons, no windows, no menus, nothing of that sort, just text. But you might sometimes run across servers that include this GUI. Logging in is super easy, as it’s all “in your face”. You’ll see a list of users you can choose from and you can then type your user’s password. </p> Don’t forget to log out when you’ve finished your work.

#### Local Text Console (or Virtual Terminal)
If the device has the typical server-oriented Linux OS installed, without any GUI components, logging in (locally) is also easy. You’ll usually see something like this on your screen:
